#### Hello :wave: 

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY :snowflake: :snowflake: 

I graduated from Oregon State University in 2019 with a PhD in stats :mortar_board: 

I've worked on applications of spatial statistics in the ecological sciences :earth_americas:, and I'm currently learning how to write better R packages for spatial and spatiotemporal analyses :package:
